These are some the books that I'm currently reading or have read.

## Mathematics

### Algebra
 – Marc Lipson and Seymour Lipschutz – Schaum's Easy Outline of Linear Algebra 
 A great choice for beginners, providing clear introductions to each topic along with numerous examples and solved problems that are especially helpful for undergraduate students.
 - Kenneth Hoffman, Ray Kunze - Linear Algebra

 - Joseph Gallian - Contemporary Abstract Algebra
Great introductory book to algebra.

 - John B. Fraleigh - A First Course in Abstract Algebra
Nice overview of several topics with various choices of what to check out.

 -  Dummit and Foote - Abstract Algebra
  One can learn algebra from just one book — and this is the one to go with.

 - C Musili - Introduction to Rings & Modules: Good book for examples and counter examples in ring and modules.
 - Szen-Tsen Hu - Introduction to Homological Algebra
 - Zhe-Xian Wan - Finite Fields and Galois Rings. This one was recommended by my friend Md Abu Fayez. Although I haven’t read it yet, I’ll definitely read it one day, inshaAllah!
 - Neal H. McCoy - The Theory of Rings

### Analysis
 - Robert G. Bartle, Donald R. Sherbert - Introduction to Real Analysis
 - S K Mapa - Introduction to Real Analysis
A more accessible and student-friendly text, especially popular among Indian undergraduates. It includes clear explanations, numerous examples, and exercises that make it a great companion for self-study.

 - Erwin Kreyszig - Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications
 - S. Ponnusamy - Foundations of Complex Analysis
 - H L Royden - Real Analysis: Good book for Measure Theory

### Topology
 - Munkres - Topology (at least till ch 4, ch 9 & 11 for Algebraic Topology)
 - Mohammed Hichem Mortad - Introductory topology exercises and solutions
 
 - Allen Hatcher - Algebraic Topology
 - William M. Boothby - An Introduction to Differentiable Manifolds and Riemannian Geometry

### Number Theory
 - David Burton - Elementary Number Theory
This is hilarious, but I haven’t really studied number theory much.


## Physics

 - Goldstein - Classical mechanics
